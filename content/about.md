Hello! My name is Boxi Lin. I am interested in computational statistics and genetic data analysis. 

Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the [University of Toronto](http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/), under the supervision of  [Lei Sun](http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/sun/). Before that I completed my M.Math and B.Math in Statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), supervised by [Pengfei Li](http://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~p4li/).
