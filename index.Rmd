Hello! I am interested in computational statistics and statistical genetics. 

I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/) with a MMath in Statistics in 2019. Currently I investigate questions related to cancer evolutionary process at [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/). In September 2019 I will pursue a Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the [University of Toronto](http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/).
